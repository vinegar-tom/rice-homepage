      <h1><span>about rice</span></h1>

      <p><strong>Mark Engelmann</strong> and <strong>Toby Ramaswamy</strong> started a project called "rice" in early 2016, for a show curated by (now defunct) musician collective Six Families. Since then, rice has continued to compose and perform sporadically, in short bursts of intense work leading up to performances.</p>

      <p>A foundational concept was to create a "rhythmic drone," where polyrhythms and harmonic motifs repeat until individual events fuse into a denser texture. Similarly important was a commitment to maximizing focus and comfort during performancesâ€”which led to an approach of composing rigid forms on a macro scale, while leaving room for improvisation within each moment.</p>

      <p>rice's initial years focused heavily on keyboard and percussion instrumentation, generally with both players sharing both duties. In early 2020, <strong>James Blake</strong> joined rice to perform a live film score, adding processed vocals to the mix, with Mark and Toby moving toward more digital tools. rice continues to evolve as a trio, incorporating broader instrumentation and reexamining its core approach for each new performance.</p>
